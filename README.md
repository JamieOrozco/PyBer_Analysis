# PyBer_Analysis

Overview
The purpose of this project was to merge data of a rideshare company called PyBer. After merging, the project was analyzed for performance and trends. There are three different market types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban from Jan to April. There was also a CSV of city, date, fare and id.

##Results
Here is a summary table of rides after consolidating into a summary dataframe. From the data we can conclude Urban cities have the highest rides, total fares, and total drivers. This is driving the average fare per driver higher in rual and suburban cities.

By analyzing the below line plot we can see total fare by market type and determine trends.

Each city type does have an overall positive growth which shows the company is growing. Additionally, as market density increases, so does total ride count and driver count. There is also high volume spike and decrease across city types towards the end of February.

Summary and Recommendations

* Gather more gather more data for comparison.
* Gather more information on ride locations to increase driver efficiency.
* Investigate the vloume spikes that are visiable on the line plot to determine why it happened. 
* Reduce the number of drivers in urban markets or increase drivers in rural areas. (Company needs to determine most profitable driver to ride ratio)
